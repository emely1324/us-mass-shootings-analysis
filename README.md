## 🔍 Methodology  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and standardized datasets with Python before importing into Tableau  
- **Visualization**: Built interactive dashboards in Tableau for exploration and storytelling  
- **Hypotheses Tested**:  
  - Most mass shootings are committed by white individuals  
  - Mass shootings are primarily committed by men  
  - Stronger gun regulation results in fewer shootings  
  - Mental illness is not a major factor (tested and rejected – data shows mental illness is overrepresented)
